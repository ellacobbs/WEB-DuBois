# W.E.B. Du Bois Challenge
Here, I recreated three visualizations that W.E.B. Du Bois originally made for the Paris Exposition in 1900. It is so impressive that he was able to create these graphs
just using pen and paper as they are so precise! It was rewarding to see he was spreading information through data visualizations about important topics that were easy
to comprehend and yet still visualually appealing. The script starts by importing the data and then moves into creating the graphs. 

# Packages
The packages used in the script were pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn
To ensure that the code will run, these packages need to be installed:
- pandas from PyPi
- Numpy already comes with Python
- matplotlib
- seaborn
